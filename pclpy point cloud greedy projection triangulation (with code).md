##  1. Algorithm overview 

   Greedy projection triangulation is to maintain a list of points from which a mesh can be grown and expand it until all possible points are connected. It can handle disordered points from one or more scans as well as with multiple connected parts. It works best if the surface is locally smooth and there is a smooth transition between areas with different point densities.
