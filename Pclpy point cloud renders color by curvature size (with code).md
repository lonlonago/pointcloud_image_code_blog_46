#  First, the surface curvature 

    In this case, the curvature used refers to the surface curvature calculated from the eigenvalues of the point cloud. The definition is as follows: If the eigenvalues of any little bit are satisfied, the surface curvature of the point is: the smaller the flatter the neighborhood, and the larger the fluctuation of the neighborhood. The change process from small to large is shown in the visualization result as: the gradual change process of red, yellow, green and blue.
