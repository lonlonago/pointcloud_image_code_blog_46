#  Introduction to use 

   Knowing the index of a point, to extract the point from the original point cloud data, an index extractor is required to achieve it, and the application range of the index extractor is very wide. 

##  1. Main function 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574476582
  ```  
>  Provides a pointer to an index vector representing the input data. 

##  2. Define the index
