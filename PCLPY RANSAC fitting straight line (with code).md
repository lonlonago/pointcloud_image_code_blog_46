##  model coefficient 

   The linear equation has three representations: general, point-to-point, and parametric. PCL uniformly adopts the point-to-point equation, and the point-to-point equation of the straight line is: where, direction vector, known points. Used to determine the line model, the six coefficients of the line are given by the points on the line and the direction of the line: [point_on_line point_on_line point_on_line line_direction x line_direction y line_direction]
